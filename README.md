## Problem Statement  
Non profits organisations are instrumental entities in providing different forms of assistance to people, animals or environment. 
Relief comes in different shapes or forms but at a very high price.
In order for NGOs to receive aid from stakeholders and other relief entities they must provide tangible evidence that captures and presents a clear overview of the success rate.
However, most NGOs do not know what to measure, as a result they are prone to bankruptcy.

## Solution
We have created a web application called "Impact Measure" that allows NGOs to upload predefined csv files for quick and easy visualization of their activities and outcomes.

## Installation
Create the conda environment:
```
conda create -n stenv python=3.9
```

```
conda activate stenv
install requirements.txt
```

To run the code:
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
